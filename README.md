您好，我在中国生活。生长于上海，现在正在中国传媒大学（位于北京）学习游戏开发。

在上小学前我便对数学与理工科技类内容感兴趣，然而直到上大学才开始真正学习编程。

我自幼听音乐，从初中开始看日本动画，现在我对人类的文艺创作也很有兴趣。

目前我的仓库里主要是使用Unity制作的游戏项目。或许我还会补传曾做过的项目。

预期在中国或者日本求职。

I'm a university student from Shanghai, China. Currently I'm studying game development in Communication University of China(in Beijing).

I have great interest in Math, Science and Technology things before go to primary school, but I started learning programming only after I'm admitted by CUC. 
I listen a lot music, started watching Anime at Grade 6, and now I'm attracted by all human's culture things: stories, arts, etc. 

Now my repositories are mainly with contents of games based on Unity. Maybe I'll publish other my works. 
I'm now still learning basic programming and game development on Unity and Unreal Engine 4. 

Looking for job oppotunities in China or Japan.
